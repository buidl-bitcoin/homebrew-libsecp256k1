homebrew-libsecp256k1
=====================

Thanks to [bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1 "Optimized C library for EC operations on curve secp256k1")

Usage.
-----------------
``` bash
brew tap buidl-bitcoin/homebrew-libsecp256k1
brew install libsecp256k1
```

NOTE: there is [an upstream pull request](https://github.com/cuber/homebrew-libsecp256k1/pull/3) that would negate the need for this entire repo.
